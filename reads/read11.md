# Images:
### Controlling the size and alignment of your images using CSS:

> You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just 
like you can for any other box.

> Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS 
code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.

> Whenever you use consistently sized images across a site, you can use CSS to control 
the dimensions of the images, instead of putting the dimensions in the HTML.

### AligNing images Using CSS:
Rather than using the <img>element's align attribute, web page authors are increasingly 
using the float property to align images. There are two ways that this is commonly achieved:

*  The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image.

*  New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images 
to the left or right of the page. These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image.

# Background Images:
> The background-imageproperty allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.

> The path to the image follows the letters url, and it is put inside parentheses and quotes.

## Repeating Images:

**The background-repeatproperty can have four values**:

* repeat:
> The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it 
is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).

* repeat-x:
> The image is repeated horizontally only.

* repeat-y:
> The image is repeated vertically only.

* no-repeat:
> The image is only shown once.

* fixed:
> The background image stays in the same position on the page.

* scroll:
> The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.
