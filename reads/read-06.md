# WHAT IS AN OBJECT?

### Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names. 

> Like variables and named functions, properties and methods have aname and a value. In an object, that name is called a key.

>The value of a property can be a string, number, Boolean, array, or even another object. The value of a method is always a function. 

> An object cannot have two keys with the same name. This is because keys are used to access their corresponding values. 

### In JavaScript: 
*  Variables have a name and you can assign them a value of a string, number, or Boolean.
*  Arrays have a name and a group of values. (Each item in an array is a name/value pair because it has an index number and a value.)
*  Named functions have a name and value that is a set of statements to run if the function is called.
* Objects consist of a set of name/value pairs (but the names are referred to as keys).

# Document Object Mode:

### The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

> #### The DOM is neither part of HTML, nor part of JavaScript; it is separate set of rules. It is implemented by all major browser makers, and covers two primary areas:
>
> - MAKING A MODEL OF THE HTML PAGE.
> - ACCESSING AND CHANGING THE HTML PAGE.
>
>  *The DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure this model using a DOM tree.*

### THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE:

### Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming:

What is the hardest thing about writing code?

*  Learning a new technolog.
*  Naming things.
* Testing your code.
* Debugging.



* Making software maintainable.

> **Programming is easy if you understand the problem domain.**
