# Box Dimensions:
### By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.


**When you use percentages, the size of the box is relative to the size of the browser window or, if the box is encased within nother box, it is a percentage of the size of the containing box.**

# ARRAYS:

```
{
 The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is separated by a comma. The values in the array do not need to be the same data type, so you can store a string, a number and a Boolean all in the same array. 
}

```
*Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero
(not one)* 

1. NUMBERING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY
2. ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY
3. NUMBER OF ITEMS IN AN ARRAY

# USING SWITCH STATEMENTS :

>  the purpose of the switch statement is to present the user with a different message depending on which level they are at. The message is 
stored in a variable called msg.

# TYPE COERCION & WEAK TYPING:
*JavaScript can convert data types behind the scenes to 
complete an operation. This is known as type coercion. For 
example, a string 'l ' could be converted to a number 1 in the following expression:
(' 1' > 0). As a result, the above expression would evaluate to true.*

### DATA TYPE:

* string
* number
* number

# loops:

A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array.
The loop starts with the for keyword, then contains the condition inside the parentheses. As long as the counter is less 
than the total number of items in the array, the contents of the 
curly braces will continue to run. Each time the loop runs, the 
round number is increased by 1.
