#  Images:
### A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.


# Adding Images:

### To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:


> src:This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This 
will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your 
own site. (Here you can see that the images are in a child folder called images â€” relative URLs.
>
> alt:This provides a text description of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.

> #### Height & Width of Images:
>
> - height:This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
> - width:This specifies the width of the image in pixels
>
>  **The size of images is increasingly being specified using CSS rather than HTML.**

### Three Rules for Creating Images:

* Save images in the right format.
* Save images at the right size.
* Use the correct resolution.

# Texts:

The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:

* Those that directly affect the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text).

*  Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters).
