# What is an Event:

> JavaScript’s interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page.

> When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.

* Events are the browser’s way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked).

* Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon.

* When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.

* You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element.

* The most commonly used events are W3C DOM events, although there are others in the HTMLS specification as well as browser-specific
