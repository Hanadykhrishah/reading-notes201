#### Linking to Other Sites:

> Links are created using the (a) element which has an attribute 
called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that 
you want people to go to when they click on the link.
>
>> Users can click on anything that appears between the opening 
(a) tag and the closing (a)tag and will be taken to the page 
specified in the href attribute

#### Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site:

> then you are linking to other pages within the same site, 
you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You 
can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.
>
>> If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value 
of the href attribute is just the name of the file.

#### Email Links:
> o create a link that starts up the user's email program and 
addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the (a)
element
>
>>However, this time the value of the href attribute starts 
with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the 
email to be sent to

#### target:

 > f you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the 
target attribute on the opening (a) tag. The value of this 
attribute should be _blank.

# Layout:
*we are going to look at how to control where each element sits 
on a page and how to create attractive page layouts.*

### Key Concepts in Positioning Elements:

* Building Blocks:

**Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.** 

* Containing Elements:

~ If one block-level element sits inside another 
block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

# WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

*Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)*
