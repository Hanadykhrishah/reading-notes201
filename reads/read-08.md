# layouts:

**Position property values**

The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

* Static:

> The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect. This is the default value.

* Relative:

>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to itself based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static.

* Absolute:

>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial containing block.

* Fixed:

>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than none

## Layout Grids:

Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography) is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.
